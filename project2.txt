Additional notes:
1. The model takes around 8GB GPU memory to train, taking about 1500s per epoch to train on a single K80 instance. The testing should take similar amount of memory and less time
2. You may adjust the following variables to test on additional datasets: q37_p, q40_p, src_p (paths of folders containing images), train_txt_p, val_txt_p (path of the text files), mode (‘q37’ or ‘q40’ depends on which dataset you are testing on)
3. The code is currently testing all the validation set. If you wish the test the 4th image only, change “for idx in range(1, 8):” at line 268 of dataset.py to “for idx in range(4, 5):”.
4. The only pre-processing it takes is divide the images by 255.0


local testing statistics (average PSNR on 616 images, or 88 images if only testing on the 4th image):
